# SpriteAnim
Create easy sprite animations using EaselJS

This is merely a code snippet that has a basic setup for sprite
animations. It runs with EaselJS v0.8.0+
I mainly created this because I had a hard time going through
EaselJS' documentation and it took some trial and error to find 
the right setup.

If you have a DOM app and want to create some fast spritesheets
in WebGL, which fall back to Canvas, then this might be of help.
EaselJS has everything covered for you, including use of 
requestAnimationFrame.
